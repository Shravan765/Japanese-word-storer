# Japanese-word-storer

Through this project, I tried implementing a software with GUI to store an english word along with its japanese translation (in both kana and kanji)
The code is written in python language due to its ease of programmability and extensive libraries.
The data is stored and retrived from a csv file named "eigo_nihongo.csv".
I have extensively used tkinter and csv library for this project.

There are multiple limitations of the current version of this project, which includes (but not limited to):
1- Inability to store two different japanese words for a single english word (though the opposite is possible)
2- Space-bar sensitive (ie words "mother " and "mother" are treated differently)
3- Making use of csv files to store
